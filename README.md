        2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find content.
       

    -   #### Returning Visitor Goals

        1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to quickly jump back into the same game I had previously played without other info first.
       

    -   #### Frequent User Goals

-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The two main colours used are peach pink and orange.
    -   #### Typography
        -   The Arial font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Arial is a no nonsense font.

### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

-   #### First Time Visitor Goals

    1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and to be able to play the game with no hassle.

        1. Upon entering the site, users are automatically greeted to the game and the set of rules and instructions on the same page.
        2. The main point is clear to see that it is a game.
        3. The user has 4 options, 3 of which are part of the game and the 4th is to restart the game which are circled in the picture below.

    2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily be able to navigate throughout the site to find content and the instructions.

        1. The site has been designed to be played and viewed all on one page as pictured below.

-   #### Returning Visitor Goals

    1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the same simple content with easy access.

        1. This is clear as there is only one page to navigate through.


-   #### Frequent User Goals

    1. As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any newly added features to the game.

        1. The user would already be comfortable with the page layout so new features would be easy to spot..
